I am a wife and Mama of 2 girls, who are always looking to go on adventures; we find ourselves most at home when we are out in nature and exploring the forest.\r\n\r\nAs a child Spring was my favourite season, when all the flowers and roses would bloom in my familyâ€™s beautiful gardens - they were truly magnificent. This gave me the opportunity to go out and collect petals and leaves from various plants, which I would then make different potions of Rose water and perfumes. My love for plants and their incredible healing properties has been with me since childhood. \r\n\r\nI have used essential oils for many years, however it was more recently that I was introduced to the incredible pure and potent oils from doTERRA. Without a doubt these oils have taken me down the most amazing path and I am excited to share them with you to explore the benefits of these essential oils from health to emotional support, home care and personal care and more.\r\n\r\nMy site is still under construction, but please contact me at jenny.a.hatfield@gmail.com for any information.",
