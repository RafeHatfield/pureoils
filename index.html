<p>My name is Jenny and I am excited to share with you my journey with essential oils. I am a wife and Mama of 2 girls, who are always looking to go on adventures; we find ourselves most at home when we are out in nature and exploring the forest.</p>

<p>As a child Spring was my favourite season, when all the flowers and roses would bloom in my familyâ€™s beautiful gardens - they were truly magnificent. This gave me the opportunity to go out and collect petals and leaves from various plants, which I would then make different potions of Rose water and perfumes. My love for plants and their incredible healing properties has been with me since childhood. </p>

<p>I have used essential oils for many years, however it was more recently that I was introduced to the incredible pure and potent oils from doTERRA. Without a doubt these oils have taken me down the most amazing path and I am excited to share them with you to explore the benefits of these essential oils from health to emotional support, home care and personal care and more.</p>

<p>My site is still under construction, but please contact me at <a href="mailto:jenny.a.hatfield@gmail.com">jenny.a.hatfield@gmail.com</a> for any information.</p>
