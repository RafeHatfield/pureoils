<p>Welcome to Pure Oils my name is Jennifer Hatfield and I am excited to share my journey with essential oils. I am a wife and Mamma of 2 girls, who are always looking to go on adventures; we find ourselves at home, in nature and exploring the forests.</p>

<p>As a child spring was my favourite season. All the flowers and roses would be blooming in my familyâ€™s beautiful gardens, which were truly magnificent. This gave me the opportunity to go out and collect petals and leaves from various plants. I would make different potions of rose water and perfumes. My love for plants and their incredible therapeutic properties has always inspired me to learn more.</p>

<p>I have used essential oils for many years, however recently I was introduced to the pure and potent essential oils from doTERRA. Without a doubt these oils have taken me on the most amazing path and I look forward to sharing my experiences, along with exploring the benefits of these essential oils from health to emotional support, home care, personal care and more. </p>

<p>My web site is currently under construction but if you have any questions please contact email me at jenny@pureoils.ca </p>
